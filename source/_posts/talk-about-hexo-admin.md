<h1>Hexo-Admin</h1>

So I am a programmer. Fresh, 3 years working experience, only know about C# DotNet, WPF and related stuff.

I am kinda interested with all these new technologies, some websites, hence I hosted this blogging website using Hexo.

First I find Hexo very interesting, create posts, publishings, I don't bother using other free blogging website because I think by all these process makes me cooler - in a <i>programming way</i> (lol).

Well if you checked my old posts' dates, I actually stopped update this blogger for half a year.

After careful consideration, one of the reason is actually the complexity to publish a new post, considering I have to use the command `hexo new <title>`, then create tags, apply markdown format, all done in VS which is quite annoy to do so.

My bad. Because I found the solution long long time ago and just started using - <b>Hexo-Admin</b>.

Bro, simply just download with this command `npm install --save hexo-admin`, and add a suffix 'admin' to your 'localhost:4000/admin', now, simply modify, paste copied images, a markdown preview is present.

Well, although I still have to apply markdown format by myself, it still helps alot.

At least I can just type out whatever I want to share, talk about.

Well, if you faced frustration by creating a new post in Hexo, just tried it out, [Hexo-Admin](https://github.com/jaredly/hexo-admin).
