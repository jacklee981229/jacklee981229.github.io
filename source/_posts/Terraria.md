# Terraria

For my whole life (25 years in exact) I don't play a lot of games. During my teenager days I have played Dota, Dota 2, Counter-Strike, and basically that's all.

Then I got into college, I have my first very own laptop and I finally has the chance to try out more games. But I can't recall most of them, but this, this game is amazing.

I've seen a lot of so called 'Overwhelmingly Positive' reviewed games, but I don't really know what they meant. And I have been introduced to this game so many times but I mean, look at the graphic of the game. It don't looks cool at all.

Then my friend invites me to join along. The journey began.

I have to be honest, this game is not friendly to newcomer. You received no tutorial and just some small hints, well, if you talked to the first ever NPC you saw in your game - The Guide.

But if you are a gamer, you definitely know you are about to farm some resources, then you put down a crafting bench, then you craft.

Then you start to explore left and right, as it is a 2D platform game. You found desert, jungle, some weird ass, purple or red biome that has some enemies strong enough to instantly kill you.

You then decided to stay in your respawn point, as you only have to deal with some sticky slimes.

And the night comes, along with the zombies. They smashed you with some bone sticks or purely bare-handed. You realized you need to do something, at least to make you separate from the harm of zombies, you placed some blocks, and it became a wall, a base.

Now you are safe inside, but you are boring as you are stucked inside your base, with the zombies and some flying eyes surrounding and knocking your door.

You opened your map, you found out there are a big unknown area under your feet. "Well, let's dig down." You think.

You start digging, you found mines, you found chests. You smelted the ores into bars, and you crafted some weapon and armor.

You died to underground enemies, you died to traps, you also died to fall damage lol.
Then you crafted some hooks, it allow you to grab any edges, you exploring the caves and you found wind bottle that allows you to double-jump, some boots to speed you up.

Then you found a eye thingy summoner. You felt ready and prepared. When night falls, you summon your first ever boss. **The Eye of Cthulhu**.

After several tries and you finally beat it. You got a dashing item from the loot box, which is superb.

Then you found jungle Queen Bee. The slime rain has started. Goblin has invaded your base. You found a tied Goblin NPC underground (who knows what happen to him).

You then beated some long, ass, ugly, purple worms. Or red, big, fat, red brains. Then you found temple under Jungle biome but the door is locked. You crafted some potions that buffs you in several stats. You found some sky islands with lake and chests.

By the time you found Hell, i mean the real Hell world, at the very deep bottom, there's where you beat the final (sorted of) boss, the Wall Of Fresh.

After many tries and many deaths from the first ever NPC - the Guide, you beated the Wall of Flesh, and you received a message.

So you know, Wall of Flesh is not the end.

You are now in a new stage - The Hardmode.

The mobs are stronger, new mines are generated, you became the character that you first join in Terraria world, weak and vulnerable.

The day you fly up to sky islands again, you have a new visitor - white dragons. The loot they dropped actually allow you to craft wings. You can **fly** now.

There goes the same process, you mined, you fight, and your journey continues...
