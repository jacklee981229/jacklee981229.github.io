# Don't Starve Together

Well, technically the title should be **'Don't Starve Together'** - as this is the game that I owned. But no worries, it is just a multiplayer version compare to the original **'Don't Starve'**.

3 words to describe the game, **Fun**, **Challenging**, **Overwhelming Positive**.

If you are a gamer you definitely know what **'Overwhelmingly Positive'** is about.

I actually not the type of person that will constantly challenge a game that is consider 'Hard'. Well, 'Don't Starve Together' is hard.

You start as a boy called <b>Will</b>, you born from a gate, whatever the name is, you start by collecting some sticks, some rocks that you can found from the ground. You seeing some trees, some rocks, but you are unable to interact. By mousing them, <b>Will</b> actually give you some hints, so you know that you need to craft some tools in order to farm resources from, trees and rocks ofcourse.

Time flies and you have noticed that there is nightfall, oh, daytime system. You don't realized any changes beside the daylights become yellow, so you continue to farm every resources that you found, amazing. Or you may just exploring the world, trying to seek through what is in the dark side of your map.

If you are lucky enough, you got your first night.

Daylight's just gone by few seconds, all you see is darkness. Well, if you are lucky enough again, you found a way to start some fire, but mostly, you are just consumed by darkness. And, you died and you became a ghost.

For your references, your character died after 2 minutes if you don't find a way to respawn yourself. Then you have to restart your game.

Maybe after a few trial, or you are good (lucky) enough, sun raised and you start **Day 2**.

"This game is interesting." - You thought.

Then you found some bee hives. You accidentally triggered it. You died.

You then found some spider nests. You challenge them, you died.

You found some robot horse (or whatever it is), you died.

You got chased by a bunch of big, fat, black wolfs, ofcourse you died.

###### What a game.

But you may survive. You started a campfire, "A base it is."

You killed some little spiders, you hunted some rabbits, you catched some birds, you started to farm some plants.

You realized that an armor is the best thing to keep you alive, you realized you have to prepare for winter, you unlocked some new technologies to strengthen yourself, your weapon got strong.

And you look for more, you start to exploring an underworld, a door to nowhere, seasonal boss.

And you look for more. In the end you realized, the only goal is that you don't die, or that you **'Don't Starve'**.
