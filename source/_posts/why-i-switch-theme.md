> 2023-3-11, I switched my theme from [Next](https://theme-next.js.org/) to [Butterfly](https://github.com/jerryc127/hexo-theme-butterfly).

1. The one and only reason why I like to style my own blogger website is that I don't find the default Next theme suitable for my ideal website. However, through the process of visiting other bloggers' websites, I discovered the Butterfly theme, and this is exactly what I was looking for!

2. Adding on to the first point, the bloggers I visited shared a lot of documentation on changing themes and styles. As someone who lacks creativity and UI sense, I decided to look for more ideas and inspiration. 

3. I will introduce some bloggers who are really good at changing theme styles, but please note that all of their documentation is mainly in Chinese.
